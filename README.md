# Community Security Analytics (CSA)

As organizations go through the Autonomic Security modernization journey, this repository serves as a community-driven list of sample security analytics for auditing cloud usage and for detecting threats to your data &amp; workloads in Google Cloud. These may assist **detection engineers**, **threat hunters** and **data governance analysts**.

CSA is a set of foundational security analytics designed to provide organizations with a rich baseline of pre-built queries and rules that they can readily use to start analyzing their Google Cloud logs including Cloud Audit logs, VPC Flow logs, DNS logs, and more using cloud-native or third-party analytics tools. The source code is provided as is, without warranty. See [Copyright & License](#copyright-&-license) below.

Current release include:
- SQL queries for [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/)
- YARA-L rules for [Chroncile](https://chronicle.security/)

The security use cases below are grouped in 6 categories depending on underlying activity type and log sources:

1. :vertical_traffic_light: Login & Access Patterns
2. :key: IAM, Keys & Secrets Admin Activity
3. :building_construction: Cloud Provisoning Activity
4. :cloud: Cloud Workload Usage
5. :droplet: Data Usage
6. :zap: Network Activity

To learn more about the variety of Google Cloud logs, how to enable and natively export these logs to destinations like Chronicle or BigQuery for in-depth analytics, refer to Google Cloud [Security and access analytics solution guide](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/exporting-stackdriver-logging-for-security-and-access-analytics).

**Caution:** CSA is not meant to be a comprehensive set of threat detections, but a collection of community-contributed samples to get you started with detective controls. Use CSA in your threat detection and response capabilities (e.g. [Security Command Center](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center), Chronicle, BigQuery, Siemplify, or third-party SIEM) in conjunction with threat prevention capabilities (e.g. [Security Command Center](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center), [Cloud Armor](https://cloud.google.com/armor), [BeyondCorp](https://cloud.google.com/beyondcorp)).
